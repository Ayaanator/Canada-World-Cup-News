        </h5>

        <div>
            <h3>On November 27, 2020, it was a <em>historic</em> day for the World Cup. On that day, Canada scored
                its <strong>first ever goal</strong> in the World Cup. It was scored by Alphonso Davies,
                one of the forwards. He made a header near the
                goal and was assisyed by Tajon Buchanan. Other forwards of the team include:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Jonathan David</li>
                    <li>Tajon Buchanan</li>
                    <li>Cyle Larin</li>
                    <li>Junior Hoilett</li>
                    <li>Lucas Cavallini</li>
                    <li>Liam Millar</li>
                </ul>
                Davies has brought joy to a lot of fans with that goal as all Candians cheered
                and screamed. Canada waited for 36 years, and Davies delivered.
                "I looked to my left and just saw all my teammates running toward me,"
                said Davies, "It was a great feeling. We've been waiting for that
                moment for a long time."

            <h1>Fastest Goal in World Cup 2022</h1>
            <h3>After missing the penalty in the last Canada vs Belgium match, Alphonso proved he would do much better
                and redeemed himself in the next Canada vs Croatia match.
                He scored within the second minute of the match, at 68 seconds, making it the fastest goal ever in the
                2022 World Cup. Unfortunately,
                Canada lost <strong>1-4</strong> to Croatia that match. Despite this, they also found victory within
                defeat. For many Canadians, that first score ever beats any defeats
                they have faced. Also, tt not very surprising Croatia won. Canada is a new and inexperienced team going
                up against a strong team that been
                in several world cups, and they did very well for a new team. They had 6 saves and 5 fouls, while Croatia had 1 save and 13 fouls.</h3>

                    at all other sports. In Baseball, Toronto Blue Jays isn't even top 10. In Basketball, the Raptors
                    won only ONCE. The get bullied by
                    the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, and Cleveland Cavaliers, which all teams have
                    over 10 championship wins.
                    So please stop the cap ðŸ§¢. Can't wait to see your reaction when Canada gets eliminated first round
                    in the 2026 World Cup.</h3>
